# QR CODE GENERATOR
#### This is a simple QR Code Generator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to input a text or URL, and the app generates a QR code that can be downloaded or shared. The project is a practice tool to strengthen my understanding of JavaScript, as Iâ€™ve implemented various features and problem-solving techniques through research and online resources.
## Features
* Input a URL or custom text to generate a QR code.
* Instant preview of the generated QR code.
* Responsive and user-friendly interface.
* Built-in error handling for invalid inputs.
## Technologies Used
* HTML5: Structure and layout.
* CSS3: Styling for a clean, modern design.
* JavaScript: Functionality for QR code generation and input validation.
* QR Code Library: qrcode.js for QR code generation.
